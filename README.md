## Windows scripts to change Java versions

* Based on an article by [Sven Woltmann](https://github.com/SvenWoltmann)
  on [happycoders.eu](https://www.happycoders.eu/de/java/umschalten-mehrere-java-versionen-windows/)
* [gsudo](https://github.com/gerardog/gsudo) needs to be installed to execute setx with admin rights automatically
* [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) needs to be installed to use "refreshenv" to automatically refresh the environment variables of the current commandline window
* Directory paths may need to be adapted, based on the exact version of the JDK installed.
* Original scripts can be found at [original-scripts](/original-scripts).
